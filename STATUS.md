## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### 1. 🔧 Server Setup (IMMEDIATE)
**Status**: ⏳ Pending  
**Action**: Run the automated setup script on DigitalOcean server

```bash
# Copy setup script to server
scp scripts/setup-digitalocean.sh root@157.245.79.172:~/setup.sh

# Run setup script
ssh root@157.245.79.172 'chmod +x ~/setup.sh && ./setup.sh'
```

**Expected Result**: Server configured with Django user, Nginx, Supervisor, security settings

### 2. 🔐 GitHub Secrets Configuration (IMMEDIATE)
**Status**: ⏳ Pending  
**Action**: Configure repository secrets for deployment

**Required Secrets**:
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private SSH key content
- `SSH_HOST`: `157.245.79.172`
- `SSH_USER`: `django`

**Guide**: See `docs/github-secrets-setup.md`

### 3. 🧪 SSH Connection Test
**Status**: ⏳ Pending  
**Action**: Verify SSH connectivity

```bash
# Test connection
ssh django@157.245.79.172 'echo "Connection successful!"'
```

### 4. 🚀 First Deployment Test
**Status**: ⏳ Pending  
**Action**: Trigger deployment workflow

```bash
# Push a commit to main branch or manually trigger workflow
git push origin main
```

**Monitor**: Check GitHub Actions tab for workflow execution

### 5. ✅ Application Verification
**Status**: ⏳ Pending  
**Action**: Verify application is running

```bash
# Check application health
curl -I http://157.245.79.172

# Run monitoring script
./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh
```
