name: CI/CD Pipeline
# This workflow is designed to run on pushes, pull requests, and scheduled events.
# It includes steps for building, testing, and deploying a Django application using GitHub Actions.
# The deployment step uses SSH to connect to a remote server and perform the necessary actions.
# The workflow also includes caching for Python dependencies to speed up the process.
# The linting step uses flake8 to check the code for style issues.
# The test step runs Django tests with coverage reporting.
# The deploy step is conditional, only running when the main branch is updated.
# The workflow is triggered on pushes to the main branch, pull requests targeting the main branch,
# manual dispatch, and a weekly schedule (every Sunday at midnight UTC).
# The workflow consists of three jobs: build, test, and deploy.
# Each job runs on an Ubuntu environment and includes steps for checking out the code,

  # push:
  #   branches: [ 'main' ]
  # pull_request:
